    <h1>Welcome to Kajuun's Corner, maybe one day</h1>
    <p>Simply hosted by GitHub, I have no tracking scripts here at the moment, meaning: feel free to inspect the code, WYSIWYG</p>

    <h2>The end :)</h2>
    <br>
    <p>I threw this together during my kid's class. Found my many websites from 2000, very amusing, had 149,000+ unique visitors I logged in just the year 2001, not logging here yet, but I love seeing such data, imagine if I hadn't stopped coding... geez, so I will eventually :)</p>
    <p>Solid black image I use to turn off my extra monitor <i>(probably not the best solution, but quick and easy)</i><a href="5120x2880-black-solid-color-background.jpg">Open then F11</a></p>
    <p>Here's my CodeSpace: <a href="https://github.com/TheKajuun">View My GitHub Profile</a> (I usually code locally, don't judge me from activity here :))</p>

    <h1>Personal Random Search Generator circa June 2024</h1>
    Note: Cannot seem to run all 3 accounts simultaneously, and using variables I seem to have to change daily in the code... tried doing a text box input for that, but easier to edit html manually, lol...<br>
    Run in Edge <i>(personal limitation - I am not logged in on Chrome because I do not mix my Microsoft and Google accounts).</i><br>
    I do not currently have the delay auto-search, only works once. Microsoft has put a massive delay that I don't have the patience to test<br>
    As of October 2024, need to run one search, and then the variables now removed become session variables.
    Check <a href="https://rewards.bing.com/pointsbreakdown">Points Breakdown</a> to see if working <br><br>

    Run auto-search: <button type="button" onclick="generateRandom()">Generate Random Search</button>
   
<script>
  async function openTabWithDelay(url, delay) {
    await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, delay));
    window.open(url, '_blank');
  }
  
  async function generateRandom() {
    for (var i = 0; i < 2; i++) {
      // Generate a unique timestamp for each search
      var Time_Stamp = new Date().getTime();

      // Vary the length of the search query
      var Query_Length = Math.floor(Math.random() * 5) + 5;

      // Generate a random search query with letters and numbers
      var Random_Query = "";
      for (var j = 0; j < Query_Length; j++) {
        var Random_Char = Math.random() < 0.5 ? String.fromCharCode(97 + Math.floor(Math.random() * 26)) : Math.floor(Math.random() * 10).toString();
        Random_Query += Random_Char;
      }

      // Construct the search URL
      //var FORMNAME = "QBNT";
      //var Other_Vars = "cvid=F977186C9D5A4FD6AC7C0A29914F5880";
      var Search_URL = "https://www.bing.com/search?q=" + encodeURIComponent(Random_Query + Time_Stamp) + "&PC=U531&form=" + FORMNAME + "&" + Other_Vars;

      openTabWithDelay(Search_URL, i*100);
