    This page should be hosted here:<h1><b> https://thekajuun.github.io/index.html </b></h1><br>
    simply hosted by GitHub, I have no scripting here at the moment <i>(right click->view page source, and right click->inspect shows not even anything by GitHub hiding)</i>, meaning: nothing of concern when visiting
    <br><br>
    
    <br>
    Welcome to my first visitors:  <br>
    <h1>
      Hi Student aka Lilly!! <br>
      Hi Teacher C. H. :) <br>
      </h1>
    <br> Created this during first half of class. Now to search for my real webpage from 2001 :)
    <p>This will eventually be more interesting. I will find my college website :) </p>
  <p>Here's my CodeSpace: <a href="https://github.com/TheKajuun">View My GitHub Profile</a> <i>(I usually code locally, don't judge me from activity here :) )</i></p>
  <br><br><br>
    <p>Confirmed - this is properly hosted, the odd update lag makes me curious where this is this actually hosted? Let's find out? Easy enough distraction...</p>
