    <h1>Welcome to Kajuun's Corner, maybe one day</h1>
    <p>Simply hosted by GitHub, I have no scripting here at the moment, meaning: feel free to inspect the code, WYSIWYG</p>
    <br>
    <h2>The end :)</h2>
    <br>
    <p>I threw this together during my kid's class. Found my many websites from 2000, very amusing, had 149,000+ unique visitors I logged in just the year 2001, not logging here yet, but I love seeing such data, imagine if I hadn't stopped coding... geez, so I will eventually :)</p>
    <p>Solid black image I use to turn off my extra monitor <i>(probably not the best solution, but quick and easy)</i><a href="5120x2880-black-solid-color-background.jpg">Open then F11</a></p>
    <p>Here's my CodeSpace: <a href="https://github.com/TheKajuun">View My GitHub Profile</a> (I usually code locally, don't judge me from activity here :))</p>
    <br>
    <p>Confirmed - this is properly hosted, the odd update lag makes me curious where this is actually hosted? Let's find out, easy enough distraction...</p>
